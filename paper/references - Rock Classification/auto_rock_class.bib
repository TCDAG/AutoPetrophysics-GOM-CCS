   abstract = {Implementation of CO2 capture and geological storage (CCGS) technology at the scale needed to achieve a significant and meaningful reduction in CO2 emissions requires knowledge of the available CO2 storage capacity. CO2 storage capacity assessments may be conducted at various scales-in decreasing order of size and increasing order of resolution: country, basin, regional, local and site-specific. Estimation of the CO2 storage capacity in depleted oil and gas reservoirs is straightforward and is based on recoverable reserves, reservoir properties and in situ CO2 characteristics. In the case of CO2-EOR, the CO2 storage capacity can be roughly evaluated on the basis of worldwide field experience or more accurately through numerical simulations. Determination of the theoretical CO2 storage capacity in coal beds is based on coal thickness and CO2 adsorption isotherms, and recovery and completion factors. Evaluation of the CO2 storage capacity in deep saline aquifers is very complex because four trapping mechanisms that act at different rates are involved and, at times, all mechanisms may be operating simultaneously. The level of detail and resolution required in the data make reliable and accurate estimation of CO2 storage capacity in deep saline aquifers practical only at the local and site-specific scales. This paper follows a previous one on issues and development of standards for CO2 storage capacity estimation, and provides a clear set of definitions and methodologies for the assessment of CO2 storage capacity in geological media. Notwithstanding the defined methodologies suggested for estimating CO2 storage capacity, major challenges lie ahead because of lack of data, particularly for coal beds and deep saline aquifers, lack of knowledge about the coefficients that reduce storage capacity from theoretical to effective and to practical, and lack of knowledge about the interplay between various trapping mechanisms at work in deep saline aquifers. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

It's located at the north of the Monagas State and it handles approximated 45 % of the production of this area. It was discovered in 1986 and its characteristic makes it unique. The strategy of development has been supported by the combined injection of miscible gas and water, this has allowed to maintain the production plateau of 400 MBPD. A previous feasibility study showed a recovery factor ranging from 50 % to 60 % by implementing AGA, that study lead to the necessity of a new numeric model capable of simulate non conventional recovery possesses, creating a model known as the V9 Model. This new approach is one of the most transcendental advances of the El Furrial field characterization. It's created over a structural model, which is based in 3D seismic of 370 Km2., which allowed a better definition of structural complexity. A petrophysics supported by 13692' of core, classified by 5 types of rocks, representing the heterogeneity of the reservoir.

   abstract = {Present study highlights reservoir engineering contribution to a reservoir characterization study. Subject reservoir is a heterogeneous limestone and dolomite carbonate reservoir, with a huge gas cap, producing under peripheral water injection. Available conventional and SCAL data were screened, filtered and introduced in spreadsheets. Measured permeability and porosity values were corrected to reservoir conditions in order to bring all relevant data to the same conditions. The main objective of analyzing Mercury Injection Capillary Pressure (MICP) data was to come up with conceptual reservoir flow-model from integrating the rock fabrics of the depositional facies with the MICP measurements. Distinguishing dolomite from limestone plugs was the first step taken in the rock typing exercise based on petrography findings. MICP curves were sorted based on various criteria to 319 come up with 16 rock types using Excel 7.0 spreadsheets equipped with macro facility to speed up analysis. Water saturation versus pore throat distribution and R35 (Inverse of capillary pressur~ at 35% mercury saturation) parameters were found to be the most useful tools in this exercise. Second campaign of mercury injection data (99 samples) was carried out in order to capture more samples in low populated rocks. This brings total mercury injection samples to 568 taken from 15 wells, in which around 50% were dolomite. The 16-rock-model has been successfully correlated to distinctive flow units (such as FZI: Flow Zone Index and RQI: Reservoir Quality Index) and in light of the results it was possible to upscale the 16-rock-type model into 9-rock-type model. The 9 rock types consist of 4 dolomite rock types and 5 limestone rock types. A stochastic model has been developed and applied successfully on cored wells, using Random Number Generator function in Excel 7.0, to predict rock number (type) at a given porosity and permeability for every foot.},

   abstract = {Understanding complex vanatlOns in pore geometry within different lithofacies is the key to improved reservoir description and exploitation. Core data provide information on various depositional and diagenetic controls on pore geometry. Variations in pore geometrical attributes in turn, define the existence ofdistinct zones (hydraulic units) with similar fluid-flow characteristics. Classic discrimination of rock types has been based on subjective geological observations and on empirical relationships between the log of permeability versus porosity. However, for any porosity within a given rock type, permeability can vary by several orders of magnitude, which indicates the existence of several flow units. In this paper, a new, practical and theoretically correct methodology is proposed for identification and characterization ofhydraulic units within mappable geological units (facies). The technique is based on a modified Kozeny-Carmen equation and the concept ofmean hydraulic radius. The equation indicates that for any hydraulic unit, a log-log plot of a "Reservoir Quality Index," (RQI), which is equal to O.03l4Jk/$, versus a "Normalized Porosity Index" (<I>z) which is equal to <1>/(1-<1» should yield a straight line with a unit slope. The intercept of the unit slope line with <l>z = 1, designated as the "Flow Zone Indicator" (FZI), is a unique parameter for each hydraulic unit. RQI, <Pz and Fn are based on stressed porosity and permeability data measured on core samples. FZI is then correlated to certain combinations of logging tool responses to develop regression models for permeability predictions in cored and uncored intervals or wells. The proposed technique has been successfully tested in clastic rocks from East Texas, South America, West Africa, South East Asia and Far East Asia, as well as carbonate sequences from West Texas and Canada. This paper documents the theoretical development, validates and characterizes the hydraulic units, and presents predicted versus actual permeability data to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed technique.},

   abstract = {Estimation of flow-related petrophysical properties from borehole geophysical measurements is challenging in the presence of spatially complex rocks. This paper develops best practices for permeability estimation by comparing results obtained with machine learning methods and conventional petrophysical models. We preprocess core data acquired in key wells that incorporate expert knowledge, depth-matched core porosity with log-calculated porosity, generated two support systems (core and log resolution), and trained with the predicted porosity and smoothed permeability. Feature engineering is implemented on the resulting data suite to select the well logs that best correlate with permeability. Dimensionality reduction techniques are used to generate latent-space well logs, from which models are trained to estimate permeability. From the latent space models, we perform regression using random forests, k-nearest neighbors, artificial neural network, and Timur-Coates's model to estimate the logarithm of permeability. Finally, the uncertainty of the estimated permeability is calculated based on the validation variance function for the test set. Results are compared based on the relative standard error of permeability estimations. The methods are tested on data sets from both conventional and unconventional rocks. Results indicate that random forest and neural networks best estimate permeability from triple-combo well logs across a wide range of variation with an average of 16% relative standard error when using the original well logs. Estimations improve when using latent-space well logs with discrete wavelet transforms. Machine learning algorithms reduced the error to less than 13%, while implementing a fully-connected autoencoder resulted in less than 10% error using the core-resolved support system. We obtained a 5% average permeability estimations error in well-log resolution, a 50% further decrease compared to the core support. The Timur-Coates model/approach is the most reliable for data sets with a priori information about irreducible water saturation, yielding less than 22% relative standard error, yet it requires prior data classification to improve estimation accuracy. The new procedure is computationally efficient, with estimations obtained in less than 2 minutes of CPU time. Uncertainty estimates show that permeability calculations are accurate, as their distributions border the true values within ± 5 mD. However, it is important to note that training wells must cover the widest possible range of measurements and petrophysical properties, and core data are smoothed to well-log resolution to improve the estimation of permeability in test wells. Data normalization does not always improve machine-learning estimations, especially across very low or high permeability ranges, resulting in a 25% increase in permeability estimation error compared to non-normalized data.},

   abstract = {We investigated the basic geological and petrophysical properties of the multimodal pore systems in the Arab D limestone facies in Ghawar field, Saudi Arabia. The study used more than 500 mercury injection capillary pressure (MICP) data, which were type-curve matched using Thomeer Hyperbolas. The new MICP sample data were drawn from 10 cored wells that transect the Ghawar field from north to south and from a previous fieldwide study with 125 MICP samples. These 500 samples have a very rich statistical foundation in that they were selected using only random decimation within each of the facies from more than 3,500 core plugs all with assigned facies. In addition to MICP data and facies, a former, smaller sample set had both facies and Dunham texture codes. A new view of these pore systems emerged, that is built upon the intrinsic, fundamental and separate maximum pore-throat diameter modal elements named porositons. Porositons are stable, recurring and intrinsic modes in the maximum pore-throat diameter of the carbonate pore systems. Analytical results derived from the MICP data showed that the pore systems of the Arab D limestones can be classified based on porositons. The benefits of this new classification are demonstrated by considering in detail the relationships to geological facies, well-log responses, permeability modeling and simple nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) well-log response. By analogy to the decoding of the Egyptian hieroglyphics using the Rosetta Stone, the use of porositons enables strong connections to be made between the geological facies, petrophysical and reservoir-flow properties of these complex carbonate rocks. The relationships between the new pore systems categories and the facies were thoroughly tested using north-south field trends.},

   abstract = {This paper presents a work-flow process to describe and characterize tight gas sands. The ultimate objective of this work-flow is to provide a consistent methodology to systematically integrate both large-scale geologic elements and small-scale rock petrology with the physical rock properties for low-permeability sandstone reservoirs. To that end, our work-flow integrates multiple data evaluation techniques and multiple data scales using a core-based rock typing approach that is designed to capture rock properties characteristic of tight gas sands. Fundamental to this process model are identification and comparison of three different rock types-depositional, petro-graphic, and hydraulic. These rock types are defined as: • Depositional-These are rock types that are derived from core-based descriptions of genetic units which are defined as collections of rocks grouped according to similarities in composition, texture, sedimentary structure, and stratigraphic sequence as influenced by the depositional environment. These rock types represent original large-scale rock properties present at deposition. • Petrographic-These are rock types which are also described within the context of the geological framework, but the rock type criteria are based on pore-scale, microscopic imaging of the current pore structure-as well as the rock texture and composition, clay mineralogy, and diagenesis. • Hydraulic-These are rock types that are also defined at the pore scale, but in this case we define "hydraulic" rock types as those that quantify the physical flow and storage properties of the rock relative to the native fluid(s)-as controlled by the dimensions, geometry, and distribution of the current pore and pore throat structure. Each rock type represents different physical and chemical processes affecting rock properties during the depositional and paragenetic cycles. Since most tight gas sands have been subjected to post-depositional diagenesis, a comparison of all three rock types will allow us to assess the impact of diagenesis on rock properties. If diagenesis is minor, the depositional environment (and depositional rock types) as well as the expected rock properties derived from those depositional conditions will be good predictors of rock quality. However, if the reservoir rock has been subjected to significant diagenesis, the original rock properties present at deposition will be quite different than the current properties. More specifically, use of the depositional environment and the associated rock types (in isolation) to guide field development activities may result in ineffective exploitation. Introduction Unconventional natural gas resources-tight gas sands, naturally-fractured gas shales, and coalbed methane reservoirs-comprise a significant percentage of the North American natural gas resource base and these systems represent an important source for future reserve growth and production. Similar to conventional hydrocarbon systems, unconventional gas reservoirs are characterized by complex geological and petrophysical systems as well as heterogeneities-at all scales. However, unlike conventional reservoirs, unconventional gas reservoirs typically exhibit gas storage and flow characteristics which are uniquely tied to geology-deposition and diagenetic processes. As a result, effective resource exploitation requires a comprehensive reservoir description and characterization program to quantify gas-in-place and to identify those reservoir properties which control production. Although many unconventional natural gas resources are characterized by low permeabilities, this paper addresses only low-permeability sandstone reservoirs, i.e., tight gas sands.},
